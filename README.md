I'm a Computer Scientist from Brazil, exactly Roraima. I'm on my first period of class but since a really enjoy programming, I alredy went after languages for study and enter in
the University alredy with a job. I want to learn how to implemment code in big companies and study the process and I know that this is not going to be show into my University'sutdy
That is why I'm alredy searching for ways to develop myself as a programmer and trying to find some job so I can see the real thing. Thanks for reading until now. Bye :)
