I'm a Computer Scientist from Brazil, exactly Roraima. I'm on my first period of class but since I really enjoy programming, I alredy went after languages to study and started my
University with a programming job. I want to learn how to implemment code in big companies and study the processes. I know that my University it's not going to show me all of that.
That is why I'm alredy searching for ways to develop myself as a programmer and trying to find more jobs so I can see the real thing. Thanks for reading until now. Bye :)
